In this post I will be giving a tutorial on how to use Python make an interesting scatterplot from the Palmer Penguins dataset.

First, we will import the necessary libraries and load in our data.

```python
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
